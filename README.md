## Foreword

This project mark the beginning of your training on the path on machine learning in production.

- - -

## Introduction

The posos challenge builds on some concepts commonly used in the growing field of data science. These concepts walk you through a part of any data driven machine learning project, which consist of training, serving and exposing a model.

## Objectives

Data science is much more than developping a model prototype. For industries, it is about implementing machine learning in products and services. For reasearch, it is about bringing machine learning algorithms to solve scientific challenges, and sharing an environment to reproduce the results. In both cases, you have to share your work with people, inside or outside your team. This can become very time consuming for you and very tedious for the others.

We hope This project will help you for all your future machine learning project

## General instructions

### Get data

Data are symetricly encrypted with GPG using a passphrase. To decrypt the file use the following command:
```bash
gpg -d data.tgz.gpg  | tar -xz
```
which requires [`GnuPG`](https://gnupg.org) to be installed.
To get the passphrase, send me an email.

### Building a model

### Serving a model

### Building a microservice

### Test results

To obtain test results, open an issue with a link to a public repository containing a Docker image.

## Bonus part

- Use of an hyperparameter optimizer on a fixed validation set;
- Use of Makefiles to train and optimize your model;
- Web interface to access model inference method.
